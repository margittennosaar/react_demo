# Week 1

This project is a simple React application bootstrapped with Vite.
It demonstrates the use of React components, CSS styling, and modern JavaScript features.

## Features

- **React Components**: Includes a `Box` component and an `App` component in `main.jsx` that dynamically render content.
- **CSS Styling**: Custom styles are applied using `App.css` and `index.css`.
